# KDIGO Health States Classification for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

## Overview

KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) is the international organization that publishes evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for kidney disease. The KDIGO CKD classification system categorizes patients into different health states based on two key parameters:

1. **GFR Categories** (G1-G5) - Based on kidney function (eGFR)
2. **Albuminuria Categories** (A1-A3) - Based on protein in urine (uACR)

These two dimensions create a **risk matrix** that determines disease severity and prognosis.

## 1. GFR CATEGORIES (Kidney Function)

GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) measures how well the kidneys filter blood. It's reported as eGFR (estimated GFR) in mL/min/1.73m².

### G1: Normal or High Kidney Function
- **eGFR:** ≥90 mL/min/1.73m²
- **Description:** Normal kidney function OR high filtration (hyperfiltration)
- **CKD Diagnosis:** Only if other kidney damage present (proteinuria, structural abnormalities, etc.)
- **Clinical Significance:** 
  - May be normal in young, healthy individuals
  - In diabetics, may indicate hyperfiltration (early sign of kidney stress)
  - Not CKD unless accompanied by kidney damage markers

### G2: Mildly Decreased Kidney Function
- **eGFR:** 60-89 mL/min/1.73m²
- **Description:** Mild reduction in kidney function
- **CKD Diagnosis:** Only if other kidney damage present
- **Clinical Significance:**
  - Often normal aging in elderly (>60 years)
  - CKD if accompanied by albuminuria or structural damage
  - Generally asymptomatic
  - May be considered CKD in younger patients

### G3a: Mild to Moderate Decrease
- **eGFR:** 45-59 mL/min/1.73m²
- **Description:** Mild to moderately decreased kidney function
- **CKD Stage:** 3a
- **Clinical Significance:**
  - Definite CKD regardless of other markers
  - Risk of complications begins to increase
  - May start to see metabolic complications
  - Usually still asymptomatic
  - Medication dose adjustments may be needed

### G3b: Moderate to Severe Decrease
- **eGFR:** 30-44 mL/min/1.73m²
- **Description:** Moderately to severely decreased kidney function
- **CKD Stage:** 3b
- **Clinical Significance:**
  - Higher risk category than G3a
  - Increased risk of cardiovascular events
  - Metabolic complications more common (anemia, bone disease)
  - Symptoms may begin to appear
  - Nephrology referral recommended
  - More aggressive management needed

### G4: Severely Decreased Kidney Function
- **eGFR:** 15-29 mL/min/1.73m²
- **Description:** Severe reduction in kidney function
- **CKD Stage:** 4
- **Clinical Significance:**
  - Pre-dialysis stage
  - Significant symptoms often present (fatigue, fluid retention, uremia)
  - Multiple complications (anemia, bone disease, hyperkalemia, acidosis)
  - **MANDATORY nephrology involvement**
  - Dialysis planning and education should begin
  - Vascular access creation considered
  - Transplant evaluation if appropriate

### G5: Kidney Failure (ESRD)
- **eGFR:** <15 mL/min/1.73m²
- **Description:** Kidney failure / End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
- **CKD Stage:** 5
- **Clinical Significance:**
  - Kidneys functioning at <15% of normal
  - Dialysis or transplant usually required to sustain life
  - Severe uremic symptoms without dialysis
  - May be designated G5D if on dialysis
  - Quality of life significantly impaired without renal replacement therapy

---

## 2. ALBUMINURIA CATEGORIES (Kidney Damage)

Albuminuria measures protein (specifically albumin) leaking into urine. Measured as uACR (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio) in mg/g.

### A1: Normal to Mildly Increased
- **uACR:** <30 mg/g (or <3 mg/mmol)
- **Alternative Names:** 
  - Normal albuminuria
  - Normoalbuminuria
- **Description:** Normal or minimally elevated albumin in urine
- **Clinical Significance:**
  - Normal kidney filtration barrier
  - Low risk of progression
  - No specific treatment needed for albuminuria
  - Continue routine monitoring

### A2: Moderately Increased
- **uACR:** 30-300 mg/g (or 3-30 mg/mmol)
- **Alternative Names:**
  - Microalbuminuria (older term)
  - Moderately increased albuminuria
- **Description:** Moderate protein leak indicating kidney damage
- **Clinical Significance:**
  - Early sign of kidney damage
  - Independent risk factor for CKD progression
  - Independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease
  - **Treatment recommended:**
    - RAS inhibitors (ACE-I or ARB)
    - SGLT2 inhibitors if diabetic or eGFR 20-75
    - Blood pressure control (<130/80 mmHg)
    - Diabetes control (HbA1c <7%)
  - More frequent monitoring needed

### A3: Severely Increased
- **uACR:** >300 mg/g (or >30 mg/mmol)
- **Alternative Names:**
  - Macroalbuminuria (older term)
  - Severely increased albuminuria
  - Nephrotic-range proteinuria (if >3000 mg/g)
- **Description:** Heavy protein leak indicating significant kidney damage
- **Clinical Significance:**
  - High risk of rapid CKD progression
  - Very high cardiovascular risk
  - May indicate glomerular disease
  - **Aggressive treatment required:**
    - Maximum RAS inhibition (ACE-I or ARB at max dose)
    - SGLT2 inhibitor strongly recommended
    - Strict BP control (<130/80 or even lower)
    - Consider nephrology referral
    - May need kidney biopsy if cause unclear
  - If nephrotic range (>3000 mg/g): specialized care essential

## 5. CLINICAL APPLICATION OF KDIGO CLASSIFICATION

### For Risk Assessment

The KDIGO classification helps determine:
1. **Prognosis** - Risk of kidney failure
2. **Cardiovascular risk** - Independent predictor
3. **Mortality risk** - All-cause mortality
4. **Monitoring frequency** - How often to check labs
5. **Treatment intensity** - How aggressive to be
6. **Referral timing** - When to involve nephrology

### For Treatment Decisions

**Based on GFR Category:**
- **G1-G2:** Focus on prevention, address risk factors
- **G3a:** Medication dose adjustments, closer monitoring
- **G3b:** Nephrology referral, prepare for complications
- **G4:** Mandatory nephrology, dialysis planning
- **G5:** Renal replacement therapy

**Based on Albuminuria Category:**
- **A1:** No specific treatment for albuminuria
- **A2:** RAS inhibitor, SGLT2i consideration
- **A3:** Maximum RAS inhibition, SGLT2i strongly recommended

### For Monitoring Frequency

| Risk Level | GFR Monitoring | Albuminuria Check | BP Monitoring |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Low (Green) | Annually | Annually | Per guidelines |
| Moderate (Yellow) | 6-12 months | 6-12 months | Every visit |
| High (Orange) | 3-6 months | 3-6 months | Every visit |
| Very High (Red) | 1-3 months | 3-6 months | Every visit |

## 6. PROGRESSION PATTERNS

### How Patients Move Between States

**Typical Progression (without treatment):**
1. **G1-A2** → G2-A2 → G3a-A2 → G3b-A3 → G4-A3 → G5-A3
   - Both GFR declines AND albuminuria worsens
   - Most common in diabetic kidney disease

2. **G1-A1** → G2-A1 → G3a-A1 → G3b-A1 → G4-A1
   - GFR declines but no proteinuria
   - Common in aging, hypertensive nephrosclerosis

3. **G2-A1** → G2-A2 → G2-A3 → G3a-A3 → G3b-A3
   - Function preserved initially, damage progresses
   - Common in glomerular diseases

**Treatment Goal:**
- **Stabilize** the current state
- **Slow** progression to next worse state
- **Reverse** albuminuria category if possible (A3→A2→A1)
- **Prevent** movement into red zones

### Rate of Progression

**Without Treatment:**
- Low risk: ~0-1 mL/min/year decline
- Moderate risk: ~2-4 mL/min/year decline
- High risk: ~4-8 mL/min/year decline
- Very high risk: >8 mL/min/year decline

**With Optimal Treatment (RAS-I + SGLT2i):**
- Can reduce progression by 30-50%
- May stabilize or even improve GFR
- Can reduce albuminuria by 30-50%
- Some patients move from A3→A2→A1

## 7. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) vs CKD

KDIGO also has AKI classification:
- **Stage 1:** Creatinine 1.5-1.9× baseline OR urine <0.5 mL/kg/h for 6-12h
- **Stage 2:** Creatinine 2.0-2.9× baseline OR urine <0.5 mL/kg/h for ≥12h
- **Stage 3:** Creatinine ≥3× baseline OR urine <0.3 mL/kg/h for ≥24h OR dialysis

Important: AKI can occur on top of any CKD stage (e.g., "CKD G3b with AKI Stage 2")

### CKD-MBD (Mineral and Bone Disorder)

Additional classification for complications:
- Abnormal calcium, phosphorus, PTH, vitamin D
- Becomes important in G3b-G5
- Requires specific monitoring and treatment

### Other Causes of CKD

KDIGO classification applies regardless of cause:
- Diabetic kidney disease
- Hypertensive nephrosclerosis
- Glomerulonephritis
- Polycystic kidney disease
- Obstructive uropathy
- Drug-induced kidney disease

## 8. TREATMENT TARGETS BY KDIGO CATEGORY

### Blood Pressure Targets
- **No proteinuria (A1):** <140/90 mmHg
- **With proteinuria (A2-A3):** <130/80 mmHg
- **With diabetes + proteinuria:** <130/80 mmHg

### Diabetes Control
- **G1-G3a:** HbA1c <7%
- **G3b-G5:** HbA1c <7.5% (avoid hypoglycemia)

### Lipid Management
- **G1-G2:** Per CV risk
- **G3a-G5:** Statin recommended for all adults

### Medication Management by GFR
- **G1-G2:** No dose adjustments
- **G3a:** Some medications need adjustment
- **G3b:** Many medications need adjustment
- **G4-G5:** Most medications need adjustment or avoidance
