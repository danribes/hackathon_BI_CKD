# Healthcare AI Clinical Data Analyzer

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered clinical decision support tool designed for primary care physicians in the European Union. The application analyzes patient clinical data from Electronic Health Records (EHR) and generates risk assessments and treatment recommendations while maintaining strict GDPR compliance.

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Planning & Task Definition
**Target MVP Completion:** Month 4
**Initial Pilot Country:** Sweden or Estonia

## Key Features

- **FHIR-Based Integration**: Connects to EHR systems via SMART on FHIR
- **AI Risk Analysis**: Powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4
- **GDPR Compliant**: Pseudonymization, data minimization, comprehensive audit trails
- **Clinical Workflow Integration**: Embedded directly in doctor's EHR interface
- **Multi-Condition Support**: Diabetes complications, CKD progression, cardiovascular disease
- **Population Health Dashboard**: Batch analysis for proactive patient screening

## Task Breakdown

The project is organized into **25 major tasks** across 4 phases:

### Phase 1: MVP (Tasks 1-14)
Foundation layer including FHIR integration, pseudonymization, AI risk analysis engine, basic UI, and pilot deployment in Sweden.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Tasks 15-19)
Additional risk models (CKD, CVD), population health dashboard, trend visualizations, and Germany expansion.

### Phase 3: Multi-Country Expansion (Tasks 20-24)
Explainable AI, local model deployment, clinical validation study, CE marking, and expansion to 5 EU countries.

### Phase 4: Enterprise (Task 25)
Multi-tenant architecture and enterprise management console.

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (audit logs), Redis (caching)
- **AI Models**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (primary), GPT-4 (fallback), LLaMA 3.1 70B (on-premise)
- **Integration**: FHIR R4, SMART on FHIR
- **Infrastructure**: AWS EU regions (Stockholm, Frankfurt)

## Compliance & Security

- **GDPR Article 9(2)(h)**: Processing necessary for healthcare provision
- **Pseudonymization**: SHA-256 hashing with secure salt management
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable logs with 7-year retention
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **Data Retention**: Automatic deletion after 24-72 hours
- **CE Marking**: Class I medical device certification planned

## Country-Specific Integrations

### Planned Support:
1. **Sweden** (MVP): NPÖ/Inera APIs
2. **Estonia** (MVP option): X-Road integration
3. **Germany**: Telematikinfrastruktur (TI), gematik certification
4. **France**: DMP API, SecNumCloud hosting
5. **Netherlands**: VZVZ integration
6. **Denmark**: Sundhedsplatform integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker & docker-compose
- AWS account (for deployment)
- API keys: Anthropic (Claude) or OpenAI (GPT-4)

### Using Task Master

This project uses [claude-task-master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master) for AI-driven development workflow.

**View all tasks:**
```bash
cd claude-task-master
node src/cli.js list --project-root=..
```

**View next task:**
```bash
node src/cli.js next --project-root=..
```

**Show specific task:**
```bash
node src/cli.js show 1 --project-root=..
```

### Development Workflow

1. Review PRD: `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt`
2. Check task list: `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`
3. Implement tasks in order following logical dependency chain
4. Update task status as you complete work
5. Follow security and compliance guidelines throughout
